# Sales Report Generator Project

This project aims to create a web application that generates sales reports based on user input. The application is built using Go and utilizes the Echo framework for handling HTTP requests and responses. The project includes two main pages: an index page and a sales report generator page.

## Current Progress

- The project structure has been set up with the necessary Go modules and dependencies.
- The index page has been created with a simple layout and a button to navigate to the sales report generator page.
- The sales report generator page has been created with a basic layout and placeholder text.
- The project includes a template engine to dynamically render data on the pages.

## Future Development

- Implement user authentication and authorization to ensure only authorized users can access the sales report generator.
- Integrate a database to store sales data and user information.
- Develop a form on the sales report generator page to collect user input for generating reports.
- Implement logic to generate sales reports based on user input and display the report on the page.
- Add more features to the report generator, such as filtering and sorting options.
- Test and deploy the application.
